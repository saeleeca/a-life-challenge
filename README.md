# a-life-challenge
Welcome to A-Life Challenge, a collaborative project that I worked on with several other engineers for my Capstone class at Oregon State University! This project is an artificial game-of-life simulation with a graphical user interface,
implementing a bottom-up approach where simple rules govern complex organism behavior.

This simulation utilizes Python, Pygame, and OOP practices to implement features such as a meteor impact event, game state statistics that
update in real time, and multiple unique organisms, fostering emergent behaviors and realistic population dynamics

Simulation Start - Rainforest Biome (Energy rich and more supportive of life)

Simulation Start - Desert Biome (Energy poor and less supportive of life)

Meteor Strikes - A random event that invites environmental stress

Modified Mutation Rates - A slider that alters the mutation rates of organisms (Higher rates mean more mutations, expressed through different colors)
